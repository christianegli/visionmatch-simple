Questionnaire Feedback
Q1:

I would skip the intro page.
Q2:

Move the intro text from Q1 into a sidebar here — keeps flow tighter.
Q3:

Keep the open text field always visible (more inviting).
Tick boxes should appear after they start typing, to keep it natural.
Apply this logic to all open text questions.
Q4:

OK.
Q5:

Instead of yes/no, use timeframes for last update (more valuable insight):
Less than 1 year
1–2 years
2–3 years
3+ years
Q6–7:

OK.
Q8–9:

OK.
Slide 10 (Halfway):

Keep the “halfway there” signal, but make it feel personalized. Suggest:
“Great progress! Now let’s get to know a bit more about you.”
Slide 11:

Add an open field for “special activities / spare time.”
Then add a new Slide 12 about working environment.
Slide 12 (hobbies):

Remove — already covered in Slide 11’s open field.
Slide 13 (screen time):

OK.
Slide 14 (preferences):

Add a slide about sunglasses preferences — for most people, this matters more than specific activities.
